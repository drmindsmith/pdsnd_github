I had to look up how to use a few functions correctly – my test in the practice couldn’t make MODE work, so I faked it by coding for mode. In my project (after seeing the practice solution) I needed to use the resources at stackoverflow, pandas.pydata.org, geeksforgeeks, w3schools.com, and a few other sites.

I watched a (terrible) YouTube video on Pandas, to figure out how can I find the most frequent two-column combination in a dataframe I order to get the modal combination of start/stop stations

So, beyond a litany of searches, I basically did the whole thing without any real ‘help’. Although, I needed a lot of ‘help’ in the manner of “damnit, what did I do wrong and why is that error happening?”
